# Terms
## The explanation for the terms used in the variable names is the following :
## -activityname 		: One of the six physical activities performed by the experiment subjects, as listed below under Activity Names
## -subject				: Integer identifying one of the thirty subjects participating in the experiment
## -MeanOf				: Mean value calculated over the variable named right after. All calculated values have been grouped by activity name and subject.
## -Time					: Time domain signal
## -Frequency			: Frequency domain signal
## -BodyAcceleration		: Body acceleration captured by the accelerometer attached to each participating subject. The original acceleration signal is separated into body and gravity accelerations.
## -GravityAcceleration	: Gravity acceleration captured by the accelerometer attached to each participating subject. The original acceleration signal is separated into body and gravity accelerations.
## -BodyGyroscope		: Angular velocity captured by the gyroscope attached to each participating subject.
## -MeanValue			: Mean value calculated for each signal
## -StandardDeviation	: Standard deviation calculated for each signal
## -Jerk					: Jerk signal, obtained by deriving in time either the body linear acceleration or the angular velocity.
## -Magnitude			: Magnitude calculated for the three dimensional signal using the Euclidean norm.
## -Xaxis				: Signal component in the X direction.
## -Yaxis				: Signal component in the Y direction.
## -Zaxis				: Signal component in the Z direction.

# Data Tidying
## A short description for each of the data tidying steps is included in the actual script file (run_analysis.R). A more detailed description is the following :

## 01. Loading data frames with common information : activity labels and variable names. 
### -This information is common to the provided test and training data sets. 
### -Uses read.table against the activity_labels.txt and features.txt files provided.

## 02. Loading data frames with test information ( test set, test activities and test subjects )
### -This information is unique to the provided test data set and located under the UCI HAR Dataset\test subfolder.
### -The working directory is temporarily set to this subfolder.
### -Uses read.table against the X_test.txt,y_test.txt and subject_test.txt files provided.

## 03. Loading data frames with training information ( training set, training activities and training subjects )
###-This information is unique to the provided training data set and located under the UCI HAR Dataset\train subfolder.
###-The working directory is temporarily set to this subfolder.
###-Uses read.table against the X_train.txt,y_train.txt and subject_train.txt files provided.

## 04. Changing variable name in both subjects data frames
###-From V1 to subject. 
###-Each of these columns will be later clipped with the correspondent datasets ( test or training) and then into a single dataset.

## 05. Changing variable name in both activities data frames
###-From V1 to activitycode. 
###-Each of these columns will be later clipped with the correspondent datasets ( test or training) and then into a single dataset.
###-It will be used to merge the activity names into the final single dataset.

## 06. Changing variable names in activity labels data frame
###-From V1,V2 to activitycode, activityname.
###-These new names will allow and facilitate merging the activityname column into the final single dataset.

## 07. Changing all 561 variable names, for both test and training data sets. 
###-Names are taken from variablenames data frame ( features.txt )
###-These new names will be used to identify the requested columns for the final dataset ( only median values and standard deviations taken over the measurements ).
###-These names will also be enhanced to be fully descriptive.

## 08. Column binding subject,labels and set data frames for test and training
###-This step clips together the subject, activity codes and measurement columns for test and training, respectively.

## 09. Row binding test and training into a new data frame (full)
###-This step clips together the test and training rows (obtained in the previous step) into a single dataset named "full"

## 10. Merging activity labels with full data frame
###-The activity names are merged with the full dataset.
###-Merge causes its resulting dataset to be reordered. By executing the merge after clipping columns and rows together, it does not affect the final dataset negatively.

## 11. Identifying variable names containing std() and mean()
###-This step identifies the positions of the elements containing "mean(" or "std(" within the vector of variable names. This vector comes from the data frame loaded with the features.txt file.
###-The positions will be used to select only the required fields for the final dataset.

## 12. Adding 3 to each member of the index list to account for the 3 initial fields ( activitycode, activityname and subject )
###-This step and the following two adapt the index list to the structure of the full data frame and extract the required fields only.
## 13. Adding indexes 2 and 3 at the beginning of the index list. These correspond to the activityname and subject fields
## 14. Extracting only required columns ( activityname, subject and those with mean() and std() )

## 15. Changing variable names to full descriptive
###-The gsub function is used repeatedly over the names list of the full data frame to convert abbreviations to complete words.
###-Thus clarifying the meaning and making the variable names fully descriptive, as requested. Intermediate dashes and parenthesis are removed.
names(full)<-gsub("Acc","Acceleration",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("mean","MeanValue",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("std","StandardDeviation",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("\\(","",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("\\)","",names(full))
names(full)<-sub("X$","Xaxis",names(full))
names(full)<-sub("Y$","Yaxis",names(full))
names(full)<-sub("Z$","Zaxis",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("Gyro","Gyroscope",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("Mag","Magnitude",names(full))
names(full)<-sub("^t","Time",names(full))
names(full)<-sub("^f","Frequency",names(full))
names(full)<-gsub("-","",names(full))

## 16. Grouping by activityname and subject. Calculating mean for each variable.
###-The dplyr package is loaded to provide the group_by and summarize functions.
###-The full data frame is loaded into a table data frame with tbl_df, to allow for the required functions.
###-Grouping by activity name and subject is applied, then summarizing and calculating the mean for each variable.
###-The same variable names are used for calculated means in the result data set, but preceded each by the "MeanOf" prefix.

## 17. Writing result data frame to output file (csv format)
###-The result data frame is exported in csv format. Row names are ommited.
write.csv(result,file="UCI_HAR_Full_Dataset_Means_Of_StdDeviations_and_MeanValues_By_Activity_and_Subject.csv",row.names=FALSE)
